    <h2>🌸 Our Beautiful Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      Nine months ago, something special started. But in reality it started way earlier, when we met more than a year ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day of the 275 days that we've been together are days that I don't want to forget.
    </p>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        💞 Our love started with the first time we meet and we didn't know it. From the first call to taking 4 planes to see you.

    <h2>🤰 A Love That Grows Every Month</h2>
    <p>
      Just like a pregnancy, each month together we learn new things, new emotions and we evolve as a married (not legally yet 😞) couple.

    <h2>🍼 What We’ve Created Together</h2>
    <p>
      In these nine months, we created memories, "inside jokes" (i want inside jokes 😞), shared dreams and a safe space
      where love lives freely.
    </p>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        💗 Just like a baby grows protected and loved, our relationship has grown surrounded by all the good stuff such as
        patience, respect, affection, and commitment. AND LOTS OF LOVE 💖
